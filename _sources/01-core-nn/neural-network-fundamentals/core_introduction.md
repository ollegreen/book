# Introduction

Often described as "black boxes", let's go through what actually are the components in Neural Networks.

The goal of neural networks is to predict something. This could be the weather, it could be anything you'd want. Thinking about how long it will take for you to cycle to work? A neural network can help with that. How many presents will you get during Christmas? You guessed it: a neural network can help with that.

**Key takeaway**: neural networks only objective is to predict something.

The goal of neural networks is to feed in data which the neural network will try to find both obvious and less obvious ways data is connected and relates to each other. This is often described as finding *relationships between data*.
