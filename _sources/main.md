# Aggressively Digestible

On this page we go through the machine learning concepts with as many examples related to real life applications, to try to really understand neural networks and make them ***Aggressively Digestible*** to understand how they work. The github repo for this page can be found [here](https://github.com/ollegreen/book).

The idea of making it digestible is to show how it would work in real life, from selecting the number of layers in a neural network to what activation function to pick. All explored using simple and intuitive examples.

Let's get into it, and welcome to **Aggresively Digestible**.
