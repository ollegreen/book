# The Ugly Neural (Duckling) Network
The idea of this repo is for my own selfish reason of: building a neural network from scratch.

The code will prioritise to be understandable over being efficient. Basically explain and appreciate the core building blocks of a neural network.

There are already a lot of neural networks out there that are efficiently written, and this will not be one of them.

The main blocks of code will come from the youtube video series by Andrej Karpathy, see link [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ).
