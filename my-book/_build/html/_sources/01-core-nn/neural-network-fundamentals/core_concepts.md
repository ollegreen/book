# Core Concepts

To prime ourself before going into each part more deeply, I'm now going to tell you the core components of neural networks that you will not know. But I want you to write down what you think it is. Doesn't matter if it's correct, just give it a try. After you've written it down, you can click to show the answer.

* Hidden Layers: 
* Output Layers: 
* Neurons: 
* Weights and Biases: 
* Activation Functions: 
* Connections and pathways: 
* Loss Function: 
* Optimizer: 
* Forward Propagation: 
* Backward Propagation: 
* Regularization Techniques: This does not go for all networks, but some required this method * called "Regularization" which is used to prevent overfitting and ensure that the network generalizes well to new, unseen data. Eamples: L1 and L2 regularization.
