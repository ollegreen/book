    "# Tensor\n",
    "What researchers has figured out is that there is one type of data structure that is really good at helping to store our information well, and these are called ```Tensors```. Although it might sound fancy, the beautiful thing is that the are extremely simple to understand and use when you get a hang of them. Instead of going through the technical terms of what these represent, let's do it using some intuitive examples of how we can use tensors to store data that we might want to predict.\n",

    "If you are familiar with python, it is useful to think of a ***list*** of values. Other resources will explain the differences, for now let's see these tensors as more sophisticated lists/arrays.\n",
